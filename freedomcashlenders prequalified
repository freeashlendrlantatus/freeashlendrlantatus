A loan’s principal amount is the amount of money you will receive from the lender up front when you take out a loan. It does not include the interest that you will owe on the loan.

For example, if you get a $1,000 loan with a 6% interest rate, your principal amount is $1,000 and your total interest would be $6,000 (6% of $1,000). The total amount of interest will be broken up over the term of your loan, just like the principal amount; however, most loans are structured so that the interest gets paid first, meaning you don’t start paying down your principal balance right away.
