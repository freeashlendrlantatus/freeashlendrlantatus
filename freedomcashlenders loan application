Your business loanâ€™s maturity date is the date your final loan repayment is due and therefore reflects the date that your loan will be paid off entirely. Working backward from the maturity date to the date of your first payment will also tell you the term of your loan. 

An origination fee is an upfront fee that a lender may charge to cover the costs associated with originating, or initiating, your loan. It can include things like underwriting costs or closing costs and is usually charged as a percentage of your principal amount.
