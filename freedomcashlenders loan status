Put simply, liability refers to the money that a business owes. Examples of a business’s liabilities include outstanding loans, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Lien

A lien is a legal right to any collateral you have pledged for your business loan. Your lender, or lien holder, may file a lien in your business’s name on the piece of collateral you pledged, which allows it to seize that collateral if you default on the loan.

Most business lenders file a Uniform Commercial Code lien, which is specifically used for business transactions and gives the lien holder first priority over other creditors that may have filed liens.
